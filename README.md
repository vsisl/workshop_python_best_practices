A README file like this should be a part of every repository. Use this file to explain what your project is about and how to use it (e.g. how to install and run it).

There are many resources online explaining how to write a good README file. [Here](https://www.makeareadme.com/) is one of them.

How to run unit tests
---------------------
In this project, we use the pytest framework to create unit tests for individual Python objects (e.g. functions). To run all tests, execute the following command from project root:

```bash
$ python -m pytest tests/
````
